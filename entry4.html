    <h1>Grandfather's Box</h1>
    <div class="bodytext">  
    <p>
        This is a hand carved wooden box that my grandpa bought once when he 
        traveled to Thailand, his favorite place to visit in the world. I inherited 
        it when he passed away, and I have kept it with me for years because it 
        actually has a little key that goes with it that locks it shut very well. 
        Recently my cat knocked it off of my desk and it lost one of its little legs, 
        but I eventually plan on gluing it back so that shouldn’t be an issue. I can’t 
        explain why, but it holds a lot of significance to me and has become a staple 
        in every room I have, whether in college or at home.
