    <h1>Family Ring</h1>
    <div class="bodytext">  
    <p>
    This ring belonged to my mother before it belonged to me. It was given to her by 
    her mother when she was twenty-one, and last year, when I was twenty-two, my mother 
    passed it on to me. My mother kept this ring through multiple moves. From Boston to 
    Florence to Madrid to New York City, and finally back to Massachusetts. Before my 
    mom wore this ring, my grandma did. Neither of us knows where she got it, but she 
    too had it quite some time. I was never close with my grandmother, but wearing it 
    or simply keeping it in my room provides me with a connection I no longer have in 
    person. My family isn’t very sentimental and this is one of the only objects I have 
    that connects me and my mother and grandmother as a continuous family line, even if 
    the object itself isn’t in the best condition.
