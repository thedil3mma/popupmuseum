    <h1>Tea Figure</h1>
    <div class="bodytext">  
    <p>
        This is a porcelain figurine I took from a collection at my grandmotherâ€™s house
        in Baltimore, MD. She obtained this item from the Red Rose Tea Company, which 
        was based out of Wade, England and began to send these figurines as customer 
        rewards in 1967. I am not sure of the year she received the figurine, but I
        came into possession of it in 2009, where it travelled with me back to Houston, 
        then to Bennington, VT when I entered college. I currently keep it as a good 
        luck charm in the soil of my potted plant in my dorm room.
