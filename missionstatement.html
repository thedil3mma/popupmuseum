  <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
  <div class="bodytext">
  <p>
    To highlight personal history and narratives within the Bennington community (students, faculty, and staff). 
    This project will center on clothing and personal heirlooms, which ideally people on Benningtonâ€™s campus would 
    share. The goal of this pop-up museum is to build a collaborative exhibit, which will connect -objects/clothing/heirlooms 
    to personal histories. By tracing the objects in time and place the pop-up museum can examine how objects are central 
    to historiography and how personal items can become an archive. With this pop-up museum we hope to explore different 
    interpretations of oral and written history. [Personal history/narratives as public history]
