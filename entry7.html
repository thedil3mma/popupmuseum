    <h1>Nana Carol's Earrings</h1>
    <div class="bodytext">  
    <p>
        Whenever I go home to San Antonio, Texas, my mom makes an effort to spend 
        time with my “Nana Carol.” Although my “Nana Carol” is not biologically related 
        to me, she holds a very important place in my life, and we share a series of 
        valuable family rituals that always make me feel at home. Every time we visit 
        Nana Carol, we eat, shop, gossip, and before we leave, my Nana Carol gives my 
        mom and me bags full of face creams she tried and didn't like and old shiny jewelry. 
        My mom and I always laugh about the things Nana Carol gives us, but every now and 
        then we find some really amazing new face wash or a beautiful pair of earrings like 
        these. I don't wear the earrings very often, but I keep them in the main part of my 
        jewelry box and they always remind me of my Nana Carol.
