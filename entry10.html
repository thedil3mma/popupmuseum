    <h1>Grandfather's Jacket</h1>
    <div class="bodytext">  
    <p>
        This jacket belonged to my grandfather while he worked as a rancher in South Texas. 
        This type of jacket was popular among migrant agricultural workers because at this 
        time, the brand was cheap. The jacket also was made to be worn in climate demanding 
        conditions, and its quality made it last years. Most of these jackets were made outside 
        of the United States and were sold at wholesale prices in stores like Walmart. Now 
        these jackets are considered to be nice and are sought after. My mother gifted me this 
        jacket when I turned 10 and I wore it everywhere until I decided that I wished to 
        preserve it as a way to be close to my grandfather because I never was able to meet 
        him.
