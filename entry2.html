        This item was given to me for Christmas by my grandmother my senior year 
        of high school. She first got this when she was travelling with my grandfather
        and went to China in the 70â€™s. It was sitting in her house until I started 
        taking Chinese class in high school, which is when she thought of passing it 
        on to me. I use it to hold special objects, like stones, coins, and shards of
        sea glass.
