    <h1>Stuffed Animal</h1>
    <div class="bodytext">  
    <p>
        This was one of the first stuffed animals my parents ever gave me. I got it when 
        I was around one year old, and once I was able to talk I named it meow meow, because 
        it was one of the first words I could say. My mom always checks to make sure i pack 
        it on trips, and I brought it to summer camp every year. Itâ€™s eyes are scratched up 
        from being put in the laundry machine, and there's a little bow on its tail I took 
        off a littlest pet shop figure.
